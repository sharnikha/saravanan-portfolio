The first data visualization is a bar chart from the OECD website describing the governmnet debt by country as a percentage of the GDP. Looking at this visualization, the main point seems to be that Greece has the highest percentage of debt in 2019. The visualization was sorted and had a neutral blue background with dark grey bars so it was visually pleasing. The second visualization is a grid of line charts that shows the government debt ratio for countries from 1995-2019. With the line charts, the visualizations focuses on the trend of changes in the Debt-to-GDP ratio across the years. The addition of the dot in the line chart proves to be important in telling the audience the state of the ratio currently. The maroon color and the thickness of the line helps the line stand out among the gridlines. It's showing a decrease in the ratio for the past few years for many countries. The third visualization I chose is a grid of column charts to represent all the countries and their data for every year available. The column charts emphasize the size of the Debt-to-GDP ratio and highlight mainly 2018-2019 ratios. I chose a dark maroon color for 2019, lighter blush color for the 2018, and grey for the rest of the years. This was to focus attention on the most recent year's data which is 2018 or 2019 for almost all except one country. This shows Japan and Greece as having high ratios.

All visualizations provide a source and a link directly so the original dataset can be accessed easily. The units and represntation of the Debt-to-GDP ratio is also similar across all visualizations. The inclusion of x axis gridlines and exclusion of y axis gridlines is also common among all visualizations. The first visualization spells out the countries while the second and third visualization use county codes. This could be confusing for certain audience since it requires more work to look up each country code. The first visualization only includes one year while the second and third visualization use many years. The first visualization has a color background so the dark gray has to complement the neutral blue but the second and third visualization have qhite backgrounds so any colors could be used. The colors used in the second and third visualization are similar in terms of the maroon which stands out among the grindlines and is not as bright as the red. Between the first and third visualization, due to the difference in the time period being observed, the first visualization shows a high ratio of debt for Greece while the third visualization shows Japan as having higher debt in 2018, so having the multiple years as comparison allows a more comprehensive view of the data and the lack of information for countries recently.
