# Final Project - Part III

For the final project, I decided to keep my audience the same from Part II since I recevied positive feedbakc from my interviews regarding the storytelling process targetted for community members, policymakers, and healthcare providers. I also changed the perspective of the policymakers to be state government rather than federal government because of the state differences in maternal mortality I observed in my data analysis.
