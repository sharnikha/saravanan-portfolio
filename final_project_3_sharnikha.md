# Final Project - Part III

For the final project, I decided to keep my audience the same from Part II since I recevied positive feedback from my interviews regarding the storytelling process targetted for community members, policymakers, and healthcare providers. I also changed the perspective of the policymakers to be state government rather than federal government because of the state differences in maternal mortality I observed in my data analysis. In regards to the focus of the project, I narrowed my hisotrical context of Black women to just gynecology so the story seemed smooth without extra facts that might not add to the story. With the historical context part of the story, I faced difficulty in trying to make it concise but also comprehensive because I wanted the flow to be from history to medical racism now. I didn't make any changes to the storyline and mainly kept it the same based on positive feedback.  

From the interview feedback, I changed other details in my story, I included definitions for prenatal care and maternal mortality since one of my potential audience members is a community member who might not understand what those terms mean like policymakers and providers would. I also added reasoning to why Black mothers were receiving inadequate care or why there needs to be diversity within the gynecology field. This creates a more informative analysis of the factors behind high maternal mortality instead of just key takeaways from the data visualizations. Another change I implemented from feedback is including a current policy that is working towards increasing access to prenatal care and other initiatives aimed at improving Black maternal health outcomes. The interviewees suggested this might be a good idea to show the progress or work that is happening currently and can possibly provide a push towards enacting that policy. 

With my visualizations, I did not make any drastic changes to the style I wanted my visualizations to be. Mainly, the changes were color schemes to match the shorthand platform. Most of the color scheme for the visualizations was shades of red and peach. Based on the feedback, I removed a lot of the greys from prenatal care and medical racism visualizations. I also changed the color scheme for the US map showing mortality rates from the green, yello, orange, red to shades of red based on low to high and light to dark based on what Flourish offered as options. The change in color scheme makes the story seem more cohesive so every visualization seemed part of the story. Shorthand was difficult to manuver initially so I had to change the layout of the slides from my wireframe but the scrollmation effect added an engaging factor to the content. I also chose pictures that were publically available to match the theme ofthe whole story. Most of the pictures are dark or black and white offering a somber mood to the story since we're discussing mortality. 

I learned how to use Shorthand which was a very interesting experience that I want to continue to try practicing with. I also learned how to collect feedback and implement it, which drastically improved my story. I showed a preview of my story to the same interviewees to heard follow-up feedback and the changes they suggested continued to improve my story. Throughout this process, it seemed difficult to imagine building a site with a story based on our own visualizations but the step-by-step progression to the final stage really helped me improve the storyline and ideas and create this final story.
