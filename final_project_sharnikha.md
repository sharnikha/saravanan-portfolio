# Final Project

## Outline

My final project focuses on the lack of equity for Black mothers in the healthcare system, particulary gynecology where maternal mortality rates are on the rise. I analyzed the maternal mortality rate by race, states, prenatal care, and included information on the number of medical residents who applied for gynecology by race to observe how the different factors play a role in the increasing inequality and deaths so future steps can be suggested accordingly. 

The storyline for the project is planned as:
1. Brief historical context on black maternal health from slavery to now
2. Maternal Mortality Rate in the United States by Race
3. Maternal Mortality by Race and States
4. Complications for Black Mothers during and after pregnancy
5. Black Inadequate Prenatal Care Percentages
6. Gynocology Residents by Race
7. Future Steps to address the crisis

## Data

1.

2. [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/maternal-mortality/MMR-2018-State-Data-508.pdf](url)

The first two data sources are going to be used for the maternal mortality visualizations done either through Flourish or Tableau. 
Source 1 includes information about U.S. mortality rates as a nation and then breaks down the data by race including: White, Black, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander, and American Indian or Native American. The data is an average for 2014-2017, which is the most recent dataset available. I plan on using this information to create a line chart to compare the Black mortality rate to the U.S. average rate and mainly the White mortality rate. The other groups will be included in the visualization as grey lines. 
Source 2 includes information about U.S. mortality races by race and by each stae. I want to use this data to create a map with a gradient of the most severe Black mortality rates to least severe based on information that is available. Certain states do not have information available due to data confidentiality suppression so those states will be identified in grey and a note will be included on the graphic.

This source will provide information about the inadequate prenatal care provided by race based on a two year avaerage. I plan to use the average for 2016-2018 since that will most correspond with the maternal mortality rates mentioned in the previous visualization allowing the audience to observe how one of the factors for pregnancy-related complications compares with the mortality rates. I plan to use a column chart for this visualization showing how Black compare to other races in terms of inadequate prenatal care. Inadquate prenatal care is definied as "Prenatal care begun after the 4th month of pregnancy or less than 50% of recommended visits received".

This source will be used to create a visualization on the percentage of races among gynecology and obstetrics residencies from MD programs in 2019. Since the lack of diversity is often connected to the adverse outcomes for Black mothers in maternal health, I wanted to see what the racial demographics of gynecology look like currently so the policy recommendations and future steps can be addressed appropriately. I plan to create a pie chart visualization with the percentages of the race and want to maintain the same color scheme as the inadequate care visualization so the audience can easily compare the factors and the maternal mortality rate outcome.

## Method and Medium

I plan on using Shorthand for the final project presentation after watching the class presentation on Shorthand. The application seems to be built for effective storytelling and I want the audience to view the comprehensive story of how Black health has changed across time from slavery but focus on recent data to emphasize the lack of health care quality and the need for attention to Black maternal mortality rates. Shorthand will help me create a persuasive but informative story for what the current state of the Black maternal mortality crisis is as recent as 2017-2018 based on data and what are future steps to take. 

For my color scheme on Shorthand, I want to keep it simple and focus on grey, white, and blue/red mostly since the audience for the visualizations and story will be general community members but also people interested in public health who will want to focus more on the data rather than be distracted by too many details. Shorthand will also be an effective tool to present to any future internship and job applications easily. I also want to use impact images on shorthand that will draw the audience in to critically think about the crisis and walk away with thoughts about causes and effects on the Black community, feeling encouraged to take individual steps.

# Part II

## Wireframes and Storyboard

I started by creating the storyboard for the project after incorportaing the feedback for in-class discussions. The storyboard contains information about the topics I want to highlight during this presentation beginning with the historical context behind black maternal mortality, providing evidence with data visualizations, addressing factors that can influence black maternal mortality rates, and ending with a call to action with recommendations for general audience, healthcare workers, and policymakers. I wanted to ensure with my storyboard that the ideas i'm trying to convey flow together cohesively instead of appearing fragmented with pieces of data and information not relating to each other. Additionally, I tried to understand how this storyboard would be viewed by and appeal to different audience based on their background with the topic. Creating the storyboard that continues to stay concise but includes all necessary information was a challenge but to create the impact I want with the audience, I need to ensure with the wireframe process, I can capture the audience's attention.

While doing the wireframe process, I realized the importance of using color and minimizing the use of text in the outline. I want to invite the reader to focus on the current crisis rather than the background which serves as an introduction so the focus of the presentation should be the middle part of the storyboard with the data visualizations. I also wanted the visualizations to stand alone and interpreted even without any other text near it explaining the visualization. The data visualizations needed to be easy to understand but also memorable either through color, style, or numbers.

## User Research Protocol

My target audience for the project remains to be general public community members, healthcare workers, and policymakers since the crisis of black maternal mortality reaches all sectors of our healthcare system from the community level to the government. Additionally, bringing awareness to the community members can create a necessary push for change. To choose the interviewees, I first started with two classmates since they would be able to critique my visualizations based on the critique process discussed in class, understand my storyboard method easily, and provide experience-based feedback since they also worked on a project. I picked two classmates that would have knowledge in the health care policy field to stand as the policymaker perspective. Another classmate I picked would stand in as a healthcare worker since she has been a physician for the past few years. Since she is also a woman of color, I wanted to understand her perspective of if I'm approaching the topic correctly and respectfully. Similar to the previous classmate, I also wanted her to critique my visualizations, storyboard flow, and check if I need any additional details. Lastly, I chose my sister as a community member since she is a regular indivdual in the community with not much experience in the healthcare system, especially in gynecology. This is to serve as a fresh perspective on my project, and this is the first time she is seeing it, so I can get feedback that maybe my classmates might not have thought about and are particular to a general audience member.    

**Script**
1. If you had to look at each storyboard slide for few seconds, what would you first notice on each?
2. What was the main idea of the story?
3. Is each visualization comprehensible or do you need additional information?
4. Did any color scheme seem odd?
5. Did the storyline seem to flow throughout the storyboard or was there a break at any point?
6. Can you understand the storyboard as whole or do you need additional information?
7. Were there too many words on any slide?
8. What was the final message you remember?
9. If you were a community member/healthcare worker/policymaker, is there any other information you would have preferred to see on the storyboard?
10. Any changes you want to see on any slide? 

**Interview Results**


All the interviews aligned on what the main idea of the project is and liked the story line and how smoothly it flowed. They also all didn't think the slides were too overwhelming or busy but cautioned to maintain white space for the final project. All of the interviewees thought the visualizations were comprehensive and could stand alone because it included enough information. Some interviewees suggested adding current policies that are perpetuating medical racism or are addressing it. Another suggestion was also to maintain a strict color scheme of red, yellow, and grey, even including the first image on the introduction slide. Each interviewee thought there was a different part of the storyboard that was memorable so that ranged from the actions checklist, state data visualization, highlighting the two factors, and line chart comparing Black mothers to US average. In class, I received additional feedback on changing the grey gradient used for other races in slides 6 and 7 to a monotone color gradient used across all races, including Black because there are too many greys otherwise. 

**Changes to Implement**
1. Change the color scheme for the inadequate prenatal care column chart and the pie chart because there are too many greys -> gradient of red
2. Add current policies that in place leading to the disparities or are addressing the disparities
3. Add definitions for maternal health and prenatal care
4. Check if any esteemed organization have commented on the crisis
5. Choose a different first image that matched the color scheme
6. Change the blue for white mothers in the line chart to yellow
