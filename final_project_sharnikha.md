# Final Project

## Outline

My final project focuses on the lack of equity for Black mothers in the healthcare system, particulary gynecology where maternal mortality rates are on the rise. I analyzed the maternal mortality rate by race, states, prenatal care, and included information on the number of medical residents who applied for gynecology by race to observe how the different factors play a role in the increasing inequality and deaths.

The storyline for the project is planned as:
1. Brief historical context on black maternal health from slavery to now
2. Maternal Mortality Rate in the United States by Race
3. Maternal Mortality by Race and States
4. Complications for Black Mothers
5. Black Inadequate Prenatal Care
6. Gynocology Residents by Race
7. Future Steps to address the crisis
