## Reflection

During the critique process, I realized what strengths of the original visualization I needed to maintain such as, the bolded title, red color as indicator for worse outcome, and the description of the units being used for the data. However, using the red color for all countries and including the flags muddled the main idea a little bit because the highlight of U.S. rate was not being seen this way effectively. In the redesign process, I aimed to include additional information about how the maternal mortality rates have changed throughout the years to provide more information to the audience on how the other OECD countries are performing compared to the U.S. throughout time instead of just 2018. I also wanted to remove any unnecessary characteristics such as the flags and the colors for the other countries. 

Moving on to the wireframe process, I analyzed the data source and saw it included data from years 2005 to 2018. I chose to focus on the last five years of data to keep the information relevant to the audience, who will likely be just residents of these countries or public health officials, but also show them the trend of increases or decreases throughout those five years. To incorporate the time component, I chose a line graph design for the visualization so the U.S. mortality rate can easily be compared against the other OECD countries. I wanted to lengthen the title by adding "Among OECD Countries" to directly provide information to the audience without them trying to find the relationship between the countries on the visualization. I also wanted to highlight the U.S. line with the color red and use gray for the other countries' lines so the main point will be very clear for the audience.

Prior to user feedback, my title was "U.S. Leading in Increasing Maternal Mortality Rate Among OECD Countries". Both users who critiqued my visualization mentioned that the title should be shorter to fit with the visualization frame, but additionaly, the words leading and increasing can be confusing together and the audience can infer that the maternal mortality rate in increasing by looking at the graph. Both users were able to easily identify the main idea fo the visualization and preferred the color red be reserved for the U.S. and leave the other countries in gray. One user pointed out that I should ensure the alignment of the subheading matches the title and the visualization border. 

After the user feedback, I incorporated their changes to shorten the title to "U.S. Leading in Maternal Mortality Rate Among OECD Countries" and aligned it with the subheading that described what units of data the visualization shows. Using Flourish, I created my data visualization with a line chart that shows the maternal mortality rate for different OECD countries from 2013-2018 with the U.S. in red and the other countries in gray. The main idea of the visualization is that U.S. has significantly higher maternal mortality rate compared to other OECD countries, and there needs to be improvement. I included the countries as labels in the viuslaization with their country codes and added a final dot to show the final mortality rate in 2018, as the present indication of mortality.
